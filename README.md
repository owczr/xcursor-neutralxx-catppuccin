![cursors_img](source/mocha/thumbnail.png)

## About

It's a fork of the [Neutral++](https://github.com/ducakar/xcursor-neutralxx) xcursor theme, with Catppuccin Mocha color scheme.

## Changes

- Changed the base black and white color scheme to Catppuccin Mocha pallette
- Added green color to the dnd-copy
- Added peach color to the question_arrow
- Added mauve color to the dnd-link
- Added blue color to the dnd-move
- Changed the red color to the dnd-circle
- Added colors to the left_ptr_watch

All files from original repository got updated. 


## Installation

Go to source subdirectory and run ./make.sh script. This will create a `cursors` folder.
Create a new directory under `/usr/share/icons` (e.g. `NeutralCatppuccin++`) and move the `cursors` folder there.
Then, update the `~/.icons/default/index.theme` file to use the newly added cursors.
Alternatively, use an application like [lxappereance](https://man.archlinux.org/man/lxappearance.1.en) to set the cursor.
